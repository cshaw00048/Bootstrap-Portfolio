                <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio page. I would first like to say thank you for
                taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I would describe
                myself as very driven. I love to work. I love to learn. I love to get
                better. I love to succeed. My every day goal is to get a little bit
                better every day at everything that's important to me. I believe the
                key to improvement is developing a process that when applied
                consistently makes you better at whatever skill you want to build. My
                whole day is a process to improve as a person, as a husband, as a
                parent, and as a Full Stack Developer.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                My family is what is most important to me. On paper they get the least
                of my time. But if you include providing for them, they get the most
                of my time. My career is also very important to me. With the
                dedication I give those two things, I don't have time for much else. I
                like to say those things keep me out of trouble. Coding can be
                considered my hobby for now. But when it is my career I want to
                continue to study in order to improve, explore knowledge, as well as
                learn other programming languages. I'm just getting started.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                 What sets me apart as a developer is my mentality. I want to be great.
                I am willing to put the work in to make that happen. It's not in me to
                be "just another guy". I have to be striving to be the best or I feel
                like I will explode. I have a very high bar when it comes to the
                expectations of myself, but I don't put pressure on myself. Over time
                the power of water can break or carve rocks. Over time the power of a
                good schedule and process can create anything, including great coders.
                There may be others out there who are better than me for now. But in
                order to continue to be better than me, they will have to sacrfice.
                </p>
